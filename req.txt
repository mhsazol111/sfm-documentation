Hello,

Nothing on hand, we have a "home made" wiki for that (but we don't share it as it contains connection data to the machines).

Then it's a matter of detailed technical and functional specification documentation.

So the technical part has to describe in an exhaustive and as precise way as possible:
- The technical environment used (core, plugins)
- The technical interactions between plugins if there are any
- The specific developments carried out with the location of files and tables impacted in databases and the impact of each parameter on the results.

And the functional part (in an exhaustive way too) :
- Which functionalities have been requested?
- How are they covered (link with the specific developments carried out)?
- Troubleshooting of specific developments
- Functionality workflows (ideally BPMN diagram)

An example of what I produced in another life just on the summary:
1. Project framework
a. Summary
b. Background
c. Issues/Objectives
2. Graphic design
3. Functional specifications
a. Scope
i. Front office
ii. Back office
b. Tree structure
c. Overview of contents
4. Technical specifications
a. Technical choices (core/version/plugin/emailing/...)
b. Specific developments (input/process/output)
c. Third Party Services
d. Maintenance and evolutions
e. Troublshoot

Everything should be as detailed as possible, not everything should fit on one page.

Basically, the objectives of this type of document are :
- Anyone should be able to take over the project without any special help and simply by reading the document.
- Technical-functional basis for drawing up a unit (technical) and business (functional) test plan
- Answer the questions: "What do we want to do? "and "How do we do it?
